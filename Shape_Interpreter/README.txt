-------------------------Shape_Interpreter-------------------------
	This program reads in shape descriptions from a .csv file, 
calculates the area, perimeter, and center of each shape, and
writes it to another .csv file. In order for it to work, the input
file must be in the Resources folder. The output will then be
placed in the Output folder. The program will be unable to locate
the correct folders if it is run from outside the project folder
or if the project folder is contained within another folder named
Shape_Interpreter. (However, the project folder does contain
another folder named Shape_Interpreter adjacent to the 
Shape_Interpreter_Test folder. This is expected and handled.)
